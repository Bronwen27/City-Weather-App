# City-Weather-App

## User Story

AS A user I WANT an app that I can check the weather conditions of any city in the world, as well as the forecast for the next five days. 

## Description 

In this project I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Moment.js, Bootstrap and openweathermap API to create an app for a traveller to check weather conditions in all major cities. The app contains the following componants: 

* A header with the current date and time.
* A search bar that users can enter any city into.
* A search button that once clicked, makes an API call to bring up the relevant weather forecast data for the chosen city. 
* Both current weather data and weather forecast data including; temperature, humidity and windspeed, along with an icon representing the weather.
